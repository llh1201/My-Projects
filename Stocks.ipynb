    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The data is collected and maintained by Timothy Carambat as part of the House Stock Watcher project, and the dataset \"all_transactions\" contains data about the stock trades made by members of the US House of Representatives. It has 14180 observations and 12 variables; including the disclosure dates, transaction dates, owners, tickers, the full name of tickers, trade types, trade amounts, representatives, districts, and capital gains that are over 200 USD of stocks. Since the data are collected through reports from Members of Congress and are transcribed by the community of contributors, there might be unfaithful data contained within the dataset as not everyone might be totally honest about their reports, especially when associated with money. **Our question is are the distributions of stocks transaction made by the US House of Representatives disclosed in year 2020 and stocks transaction disclosed after year 2020 different?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have the columns **\"disclosure_year\" and \"type\"**, we perform a permutation test based on the information provided and find out if the distributions of trade types differ significantly between 2020 and years after 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning and EDA\n",
    "For data cleaning, first of all, we dropped columns \"ptr_link\", \"asset_description\" and \"amount\" so that our dataframe looks tidier since they are irrelevant to our project. Then, we **replaced all the \"--\" values with null**. Furthermore, since we are comparing between 2020 and years after 2020 (containing both 2021 and 2022), we also changed the \"disclosure_year\" column from [2020,2021,2022] to [2020, 2021]. We changed 2022 into 2021 and treated them as the same group. So in our case, all stocks disclosed in either 2021 or 2022 are displayed as 2021 in \"disclosure_year\" column. \n",
    "\n",
    "For columns \"disclosure_year\" and \"type\", we looked at both of their distributions and found that there are no unreasonable values and strings, so we don't need to get rid of any unreasonable values and this makes things easy for us to analyze. Also, since the amounts of stocks disclosed in 2020 and in years after 2020 are quite different, we decided to compare the distributions of stocks in two periods through the proportions rather than the number of stocks. Moreover, we assumed that there might be unfaithful data as people tend to lie when dealing with money. Indeed, after analyzing the amount range reported by representatives,  we found very doubtful fact from the dataset that proves unfaithful data exists. But since our question is not related to representatives and the number of stock values, we can ignore the fact that some unfaithful data exists in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment of Missingness\n",
    "While cleaning the data, we notice the dataset has only one column with non-trivial missingness called \"owner\", which represents missing values with np.NaN and \"--\". However, **there is no NMAR column** because while the \"owner\" column contains a large amount of missing data, instead of randomly choose not to answer owner information, there are other possible factors like **representative, district, and cap gains**, that make the representatives choose to not answer such questions for their own benefit during data generating.<br>\n",
    "After running simulations in permutation tests with **level of significance at 0.01** for better accuracy, the probability of the distributions of \"cap_gains_over_200_usd\", \"district\", and \"representative\" when \"owner\" is the same is 0.00, indicating that \"owner\" depends on all of the three columns. After running permutation test, we discover that owner largely dependend on the column \"cap_gains_over_200_usd\" and \"district\" because the observed total variation distance and stimulateed total variation cannot be drawn in one graph. The missingness might help us better analyze whether the congressmen hide their transaction information on purpose and what are the factors that lead to such decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Test\n",
    "We perform a permutation test.The null hypothesis is **\"the trade types of stocks disclosed in 2020 and trade types of those disclosed in 2021 and 2022 have the same distribution. The difference we saw was due to random chance\"**, and the alternative hypothesis is **\"the trade types of stocks disclosed in 2020 has different distribution from the trade types of those disclosed in 2021 and 2022\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test statistic: Total variation distance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level of significance: 0.01 / 1%**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resulting p-value: 0.0**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Given that p-value is so small that is even smaller than our p-value cutoff, **we reject the null hypothesis** that \"the trade types of stocks disclosed in 2020 and trade types of those disclosed in 2021 and 2022 have the same distribution. The difference we saw was due to random chance\". To determine the further reason behind such a phenomenon, we'll look for more dataset for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The reason why TVD is an ideal test statistic is that we are comparing two categorical distributions. The level of significance is 0.01 rather than 0.05 because we want to be more strict on the significant level standard and arrive at a more convincing conclusion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, we'll implement more datasets to create a more comprehensive resources to answer our questions and we might use dataset that is relative with stock market and Covid-19 Cases. \n",
